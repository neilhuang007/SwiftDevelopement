      <h2>About Pythagoras</h2>
      <p>Pythagoras was an ancient Greek mathematician, philosopher, and founder of the Pythagorean school. He is best known for the Pythagorean theorem, which describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.</p>
      <p>Born: c. 570 BCE, Samos, Greece<br>
        Died: c. 495 BCE, Metapontum, Italy</p>
      <p>Pythagoras made significant contributions to mathematics, music theory, and cosmology. He believed in the harmony of the universe and the interconnectedness of all things, influencing both ancient and modern philosophical and scientific thought.</p>

    <p>The Pythagorean theorem describes a fundamental relationship in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In mathematical terms, it can be expressed as:</p>
    <p>c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>Where c represents the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides.</p>
    <p>The Pythagorean theorem has numerous applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and architecture.</p>
